# Thunderbolt Browser

PROJECT SYNOPSIS

Title of the project:
              Thunderbolt web browser

Reasons for choosing the topic:
             Internet has become a very important part of our lives nowadays. The medium of accessing the internet is through Web browser. However, as we use these browsers in a day to day basis we come across these frustrating problems of slow loading time, unexpected crashing and strange pop-ups. These big browsers also take advantage of their huge user base by compromising on security, using cookies, monitoring your search patterns to recommend you products and services. Not only does this slow down your browser but also takes a toll on users’ privacy. This is why we decided to develop a web browser that’s simple, easy to use, secured and gives you fast loading web pages that just saves the users time without being wasted by cookies and other web monitoring tools. Thunderbolt browser has been developed on PyCharm.
